# MFS-Transformer
Fractal deep learning (FDL) architecture is proposed, enabling direct learning and optimization within the fractal domain. Specifically, MFS-Transformer model based on a learnable multifractal spectrum and fractal filtering is proposed under FDL architecture. This file provides the code for the basic model of MFS-Transformer, which is open-source and available for researchers to download and use.
